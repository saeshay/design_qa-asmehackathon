"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image showing seven CAD views (each boxed in black) of our vehicle design. The top, big view shows a close-up view of the design. The six smaller views on the bottom of the image show different complete views of the CAD of the vehicle and are provided for context. Note that the close-up view orientation matches one of the six complete view orientations. The close-up view may also have some components hidden (with respect to the corresponding complete view) for visualization of specific components. Looking at the close-up view, is/are any part of the the front hoop or the front roll hoop visible in the close-up view?
