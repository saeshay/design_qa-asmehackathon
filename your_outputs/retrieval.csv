We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. What does rule V.1.1 state exactly? Answer with only the text of the rule and no other words.,"Open Wheel
Open Wheel vehicles must satisfy all of the following criteria:
a. The top 180Â° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically
above the wheel.
b. The wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side.
c. No part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending
vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of, the outer diameter of the
front and rear tires in the side view elevation of the vehicle, with tires steered straight
ahead. This keep out zone will extend laterally from the outside plane of the wheel/tire
to the inboard plane of the wheel/tire.",insufficient
