"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,V.1.2a.jpg,direct,The image shows the dimension of the cars wheelbase and it is clearly greater than the rules minimum wheelbase.,dataset/rule_compliance/rule_dimension_qa/context/V.1.2a.jpg,INSUFFICIENT
