GR - GENERAL REGULATIONS
GR.1 FORMULA SAE COMPETITION OBJECTIVE
GR.1.1 Collegiate Design Series
SAE International's Collegiate Design Series (CDS) programs prepare undergraduate and
graduate engineering students in a variety of disciplines for future employment in mobility-
related industries by challenging them with a real world, engineering application.
Through the Engineering Design Process, experiences may include but are not limited to:
• Project management, budgeting, communication, and resource management skills
• Team collaboration
• Applying industry rules and regulations
• Design, build, and test the performance of a real vehicle
• Interact and compete with other students from around the globe
• Develop and prepare technical documentation
Students also gain valuable exposure to and engagement with industry professionals to
enhance 21st century learning skills, to build their own network and help prepare them for the
workforce after graduation.
GR.1.2 Formula SAE Concept
The Formula SAE® competitions challenge teams of university undergraduate and graduate
students to conceive, design, fabricate, develop and compete with small, formula style
vehicles.
GR.1.3 Engineering Competition
Formula SAE® is an engineering education competition that requires performance
demonstration of vehicles in a series of events, both off track and on track against the clock.
Each competition gives teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering
skills in comparison to teams from other universities around the world.
GR.1.4 Vehicle Design Objectives
GR.1.4.1 Teams are to assume that they work for an engineering firm that is designing, fabricating,
testing and demonstrating a prototype vehicle.
GR.1.4.2 The vehicle should have high performance and be sufficiently durable to successfully complete
all the events at the Formula SAE competitions.
GR.1.4.3 Additional design factors include: aesthetics, cost, ergonomics, maintainability, and
manufacturability.
GR.1.4.4 Each design will be judged and evaluated against other competing designs in a series of Static
and Dynamic events to determine the vehicle that best meets the design goals and may be
profitably built and marketed.
GR.1.5 Good Engineering Practices
Vehicles entered into Formula SAE competitions should be designed and fabricated in
accordance with good engineering practices.

(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.

T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that

APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the

T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:

affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 65 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
T.4.3.4 When an analogue signal is used, the BSE sensors will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.3.5 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the BSE signal:
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
